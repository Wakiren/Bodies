BODIES is a survival horror RPG where you play as Sam Skyler, a forensic doctor who, after a car accident, gets thrown into a pile of bodies by a mad doctor who stole her skin. With a disfigured body and scarce allies, you will have to traverse the doctors’ property searching for clues on why this is happening and how you can recover your flesh.
Will you find your flesh? Or will you lose your mind?

# Regarding Combat System:

Right now, we found issues to reset player input, so the player is always attacking no matter what after the attack button is pressed. 
Despite that, the system itself works and it is visible on the console LOGS in case you want to check. Thank you for your understanding.
